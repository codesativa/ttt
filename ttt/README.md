## Current Functionalities

### TTT 1.0 
This baby bot has a lot of growing up to do. At the moment, it listens for messages on the server, and logs in console information about the message. It uses two custom classes: TTT and TTType. 
* TTT gathers message meta information and its show_ticket method displays the info in console.  
* TTType will assure the return text transformation is appropriate to the type of message desired.

## Future Functionnalities

TTT is meant to run one slash command with 3 required options: a target user, a transformation type and a lenght of time. The bot will then automatically delete the target users messages for the desired time, and reply with a custom message.
No more. No less for the moment. 

## PRIVACY POLICY

Use this bot at your own risk. Every message will be logged to server console history, even if you delete the message. You've been warned.
