## INFORMATION

* name: TTT,
* current version: 1.0,
* author: codesativa,

* description: A message manipulation bot.

## Installation

Install TTT on your server here: [install TTT](link here)

## Description

Ever wanted to have a bot in your server to delete all of your messages and reply with the same things over and over again?? BOY do I have the tool for you!

This bot is currently in proof of concept phase. 

### Future Functionnalities

The goal for TTT is to run one slash command with 3 required options: a target user, a transformation type and a lenght of time. The bot will then automatically delete the target users messages for the desired time, and reply with a custom message depending on transformation.
No more.

### Current Functionalities

In TTT1.0, we do one thing: Delete all incoming user messages and customise a bot reply. It used to do more, but I somehow regressed in the process while I was coding. ^^'

## FOR NERDS ONLY

### TTT CLASS 
This baby class has a lot of growing up to do. At the moment, the bot is active on all channels, and can log in console information about the message. It uses a custom classe: TTT. 
* TTT 

#### methods
> **__init__**: the usual.

> **show_console_ticket(message, client)**: logs message metadata in console

> **deletemessage(message)**: might need corrections. deletes an TTT's corresponding 

## PRIVACY POLICY

Use this bot at your own risk. Every message could/will be logged to server console history, even if you delete the message. You've been warned.
